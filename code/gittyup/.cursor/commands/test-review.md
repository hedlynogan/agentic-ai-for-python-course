# Review Unit Tests Command

Act as a software quality engineer and python expert. 

We have a series of unit tests in this project. Our job today is to review them and ensure they still pass. This includes checking that:

1. Unit tests exist and are executable by pytest.
2. pytest is installed in the virtual environment and specified as a dev dependency.
3. There is a proper pytest.ini configuration file and it is optimized for our code structure.
4. All unit tests pass.
5. Unit tests should not emit warnings (it should be a "clean run").

Perform this review and analysis and give a summary to the user.

Do NOT create any markdown report files unless instructed further below by the user.
